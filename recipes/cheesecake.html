    <h2 class="title">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make crust: Mix together cookie crumbs, melted butter, and sugar in a
        medium bowl. Press mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sauce: Combine raspberries, water, sugar, and cornstarch in a
        saucepan. Bring to a boil and continue boiling until sauce is thick,
        about 5 minutes. Strain through a mesh strainer to remove seeds.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Make cheesecake: Melt white chocolate chips with half-and-half in a
        metal bowl over a pan of simmering water; stir occasionally until
        smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix together cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl until smooth. Beat
        in eggs one at a time. Blend in vanilla and melted white chocolate
        mixture. Pour 1/2 of the batter over crust. Spoon 3 tablespoons
        raspberry sauce over batter. Pour remaining cheesecake batter on top.
        Spoon 3 tablespoons raspberry sauce over batter. Swirl batter with the
        tip of a knife to create a marbled effect.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until filling is set, 55 to 60 minutes. Cool
        cheesecake at room temperature, then cover with plastic wrap and
        refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, 8 hours to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove cheesecake from the pan and serve with remaining raspberry sauce.
      </li>
